        "description": "England's Secret Weapon explores the way Hollywood used Sherlock Holmes in a series of fourteen films spanning the years of World War II in Europe, from The Hound of the Baskervilles in 1939 to Dressed to Kill in 1946. Basil Rathbone’s portrayal of Holmes has influenced every actor who has since played him on film, TV, stage and radio, yet the film series has, until now, been neglected in terms of detailed critical analysis. The book looks at the films themselves in combination with their historical context and examines how the studio ‘updated’ Holmes and recruited him to fight the Nazis, steering a careful course between modernising the detective and making sure he was still recognisable as the ‘old Holmes’ in clothes, locations and behaviour.",

        "description": "One of the most popular and widely known characters in all of fiction, Sherlock Holmes has an enduring appeal based largely on his uncanny ability to make the most remarkable deductions from the most mundane facts. The very first words that Sherlock Holmes ever says to Dr. Watson are, \"How are you? You have been in Afghanistan, I perceive.\" Watson responds, \"How on earth did you know that?\" And so a crime-solving legend is born. In The Scientific Sherlock Holmes, James O'Brien provides an in-depth look at Holmes's use of science in his investigations. Indeed, one reason for Holmes's appeal is his frequent use of the scientific method and the vast scientific knowledge which he drew upon to solve mysteries. For instance, in heart of the book, the author reveals that Holmes was a pioneer of forensic science, making use of fingerprinting well before Scotland Yard itself had adopted the method. One of the more appealing aspects of the book is how the author includes real-world background on topics such as handwriting analysis, describing how it was used to capture the New York Zodiac killer and to clinch the case against the Lindbergh baby kidnapper. Sherlock Holmes was knowledgeable about several sciences, most notably chemistry. Therefore the book takes a close look at Holmes the chemist and discusses, for example, chemical poisons such as carbon monoxide, chloroform, and Prussic acid (the historical name for hydrogen cyanide). The author also debunks Isaac Asimov's famous assertion that Holmes was a blundering chemist. In addition, the book discusses mathematics, physics, biology, astronomy, meteorology, and geology, always in the context of Holmes's exploits. Sherlock Holmes continues to fascinate millions of readers and movie goers alike. The Scientific Sherlock Holmes is a must-read for the legion of fans of this most beloved of all fictional detectives.",

        "description": "Sherlock Holmes was still an undergraduate when Squire Trevor pointed out the direction of his future life's work, telling him that all the detectives of fact and of fancy would be children in your hands.His prediction was right on the mark: so it was then, and so it remains more than a century later. Never mind that Trevor's name wasn't really Trevor, or that Holmes hid the name of his university. Or perhaps you do mind, as so many have before you. It was such a like-minded group of people who got together in 1934 to found the world's first Sherlockian organization, The Baker Street Irregulars. With the end of the Second World War came the opportunity to found a means of publishing their studies in Sherlock Holmes and the Sherlockian world, The Baker Street Journal. Long the first place the inquirer should look for answers to Sherlockian puzzles or the posing of new ones, The Baker Street Journal still flourishes, both as a journal of record of Sherlockian activities in America and throughout the world, and as the premier publication devoted to the writings about the Writingsand to keeping green the memory of the world's first consulting detective. The practitioners of the game have at their best offered learned works that they have written with their tongues planted firmly in their cheeks. Their tone has ranged from mock-heroic through the archly chiding to the playful, in prose and verse or in combinations of the two. Sherlock Holmes by Gas-Lamp is the first time that the best of these writings has been gathered in one place. Some of the prominent players of the game have included such luminaries in various walks of life as Christopher Morley, Franklin D. Roosevelt, T. S. Eliot, Vincent Starrett, Elmer Davis, Harry S. Truman, Franklin P. Adams, and Ellery Queen.",
